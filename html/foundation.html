The National Society of Professional Insurance Investigators (NSPII) has created a charitable giving foundation called the NSPII Foundation.  Its Mission Statement is as follows:
<p>
The National Society of Professional Insurance Investigators Foundation is the charitable arm of the National Society of Professional Insurance Investigators (NSPII), which is a non-profit organization established for the purpose of providing support, education, and training to individuals who demonstrate the highest degree of professionalism in conducting insurance investigation.  The Foundation has been established to promote education, training and other support services in the realm of insurance investigation through project funding, grants, and scholarships.  The goal of the Foundation is to educate the public about the problem of insurance fraud and to do everything possible to prevent insurance fraud, and to mitigate the societal and economic cost of insurance fraud, with support provided through funds raised from the public and private sectors, including government, corporate and private donations, distributed to worthy educational and training projects and programs, and public interdiction agencies such as fire department and other law enforcement offices.
<p>
The NSPII Foundation is formally recognized as a tax exempt, 501 (c)(3) non-profit corporation. The Board is comprised of Chuck Jennings of Jennings Wheeler & Haley, P.C.; Joe Groh with American Modern Insurance Group; Miles Watters with State Farm Insurance Co.; Warren Keller of Taylor, Keller & Oswald, PLLC; and Jonathan Libbert of Johnson, Cambra & Sherwood, Inc. who serves as its Treasurer.
<p>
"Our dedication extends beyond normal organizational borders," said Warren Keller, NSPII Foundation President.  "It is a pleasure to do work that makes a difference."  The NSPII Foundation is already the recipient of several well-intended donations.
